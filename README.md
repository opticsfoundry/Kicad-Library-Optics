## Introduction

[KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) is an open source electronic design software. However, we have developed this library to be able to design optical setup.
The procedure of producing an optical setup with Robot developed by OpticsFoundry is shown below.

## How to add library to KiCad

1. Install KiCad from [here](https://www.kicad.org/),
2. Download or clone this repository to your computer as shown below,

![download library](img/download-library.png)

3. Unzip the downloaded folder and move the folder to an appropriate path if you want,
4. Open the KiCad software, from `Preferences` tab, click on `Configure Paths...` as shown below,

![configure paths](img/configure-path.png)

5. Add a new path, name it `KIGITHUB` with path `https://github.com/KiCad`. As shown below,

![kigithub path](img/kigithub-path.png)

6. Add another one and name it `KICAD_FIREFLY_OPTICS`, for the path click on folder icon and go to the path which the library has been downloaded then select `Optics` folder. As shown in following pictures,

![select path](img/path-for-library.png)

![kicad path](img/kicad-library-path.png)

7. At the end click on `OK` and close the window,
8. Now from `Preferences` tab, click on `Manage Symbol Libraries...`,
9. Add a new row and call it `Optics` with library path `${KICAD_FIREFLY_OPTICS}/Symbols/Optics.kicad_sym`. As shown below,

![symbol path](img/symbol-library.png)

10. Then click on `OK` and close the window. If you encounter an error like below, probably the path is not defined correctly,

![error symbol](img/error.png)

11. From `Preferences` tab, click on `Manage Footprint Libraries...`,
12. Add a new row and call it `Optics` with library path `${KICAD_FIREFLY_OPTICS}/Footprints/Optics.pretty`, at the end click on `OK` and close the window. As shown below,

![footprint path](img/footprint-library.png)

13. To make sure the library has been added correctly, click on `Symbol Editor` and `Footprint Editor` in `Tools` tab. As shown below,

![tools](img/tools.png)

14. Search for `Optics` library in search bar, you should be able to see list of all the optical symbols and footprint. As shown in following pictures,

![symbols](img/symbol-items.png)

![footprints](img/footprint-items.png)

15. Done! Now you are ready to start a new optical design.

## Start a new design

Now you can start a new project and open schematic editor to design your optical setup, as shown below.

![new project](img/new-project.png)

You could also copy one of the [examples](https://github.com/opticsfoundry/Kicad-Library-Optics/tree/main/Examples/) or use one of the [Free Projects](#free-projects) for starting point.

`Note` Standard optics hight is 7.5 mm, if optics hight of your components is smaller or bigger, please write to us: opticsfoundry@gmail.com

`Note` If you need a specific baseplate size or any other components which are not available in `Symbols`, please write to us: opticsfoundry@gmail.com

### Schematic

Based on your design, you need to choose baseplate size for your board.

![baseplate size](img/add-baseplate.png)

If your page size is smaller than baseplate, you can change it in the page settings from `File` tab for schematic and footprint editors.

Schematic editor looks like this after adding baseplate.

![schematic with baseplate](img/schem-baseplate.png)

I have added two collimators and mirrors to design a fiber to fiber setup.

![fiber to fiber design](img/fiber-to-fiber.png)

By selecting wire, you can draw the beam path.

![wireing](img/wireing.png)

Each component need to be defined by selecting the component and changing the value based on what is your need.

### PCB

After finishing your design, save all changes in schematic editor. NOw you could move to PCB editor and update your PCB from Schematic.

`Note` You could also update PCB design each time after adding any new components.

Click on `Update PCB from Schematic...` in PCB editor, then update PCB and close the window as shown below.

![update PCB](img/update-pcb.png)

Now the PCB looks like this:

![PCB after update](img/pcb-after-update.png)

Each component need to be selected and reposition and rerotate based on reality.
